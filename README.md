## Sentence Ordering and Coherence Modeling using Neural Networks

NLP Course Project for CSC 791

Modeling the structure of coherent texts is a key NLP problem. A well-written text has a particular high-level logical and topical structure.  The actual word and sentence choices and their transitions come together to convey the purpose of the text.  Our primary goal is to build models that can learn the structure by arranging a given set of sentences to make coherent text.
